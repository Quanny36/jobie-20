<h2>Mission</h2>



<p class="article">The <strong>SOBIE</strong> mission is to encourage business faculty members to respond to current economic and market issues,

    and find practical solutions to the many problems business people and public policymakers confront.



    <strong>SOBIE</strong> invites both traditional and interdisciplinary research. Research is essential to the continuity and pursuit

    of knowledge. The seeds for economic growth, market innovation, more effective business practices, consumer trends, and greater

    profits often come from the ideas we germinate through our research.



    <strong>SOBIE</strong> is based on the idea that viable, peer-reviewed research at small colleges and regional universities needed

    to be recognized. Faculty, non-academic professionals, business people, doctoral candidates, graduate students, and undergraduate

    students should attend.



    <strong>SOBIE</strong>'s journal, <strong>JOBIE</strong> is listed in Cabell's directory.</p>





<h2>History</h2>



<p class="article"><strong>SOBIE</strong> was founded in 1999 by Doug Barrett and the late Jim Couch, both from the University of North Alabama,

    with about 30 participants from 5 schools.



    <strong>SOBIE</strong> is now the premier academic conference for small and regional universities, attracting participants from

    almost every state, several countries, businesses, and government agencies.</p>







<h2>Student Research</h2>



<p class="article">Since its inception, <strong>SOBIE</strong> has made a commitment to advance the academic and career opportunities for both graduate

    and undergraduate students.



    Research is an extension of the classroom, preparing the next generation of scholars - inspire their future, enhance their resume! Many small

    liberal arts colleges encourage their students to attend <strong>SOBIE</strong> to present their senior theses.



    <strong>SOBIE</strong> is especially proud of its long, impressive list of student alumni! Each year, several former <strong>SOBIE</strong>

    student presenters returned as professors.



    Please encourage them to make <strong>SOBIE</strong> a highlight of their academic career, preparing them for graduate study or their careers.</p>
